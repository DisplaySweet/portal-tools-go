Portal Tools Go

This is a collection of concise tools to interface with DisplaySweet's portal-go API.
These tools are intended to be used and chained with the CLI to affect results in the DS portal.

For tools that return a general list of objects (for example; Projects, Companies, etc) output the data to a .txt file, or to the terminal. These tools will output display only KEY information of the object (e.g. ID:NAME).

For tools that return a specific object itself (for example; a project, a company, etc) output the data to a .json file, or to the terminal. These tools will output ALL of the object information.
